THE THIRD IS ONLY USED IN SUIMULATED ANNEALING WHERE WE HAVE TO SEARCH A SOLUTION THAT CONSIDER ALSO CASES IN WHICH COULD BE  MANY PROBLEMS. IN THE IMPLEMENTATION I USED FITNESS1 AND FITNESS3 BUT I ALSO TRIED IN THE PREVIOUS DAYS TO IMPLEMENTO FITNESS2 AND FITNESS3. THE RESULT IN THE FIRT IMPLEMENTATION IS BETTER FOR SIMPLY HILL CLIMBING.
