#README.md
In this directory I wanted to include the file from lab 2 where I implemented an evolutionary strategy on my own. To do this I based myself on the material provided in class, in particular on the slides relating to the evolutionary strategies module with reference to evolutionary algorithms. My idea was to use a strategy that included the moves represented by the Nimply class with the two fields ROW and N_OBJECTS. I thus developed an evolutionary strategy that I included in my solution and which had the aim of creating a population of individuals with a certain number of mutations or recombinations. Then everything was completed with an increase in the population by adding lambda elements into the population. I carried out the selection of the "parents" following the TOURNAMENT SELECTION strategy and from there I calculated the best strategy whose aim was to use the nim_sum function to select the strategy that was best based on the state of the current game. The result obtained is that of an evolutionary mode that adapted to the situation that the game posed. The function I use is "savior" which includes the evolutionary strategy called "es_with_tournment". I had the user play with both Gabriele and Optimal which represent the other two strategies.
